    "- A moving average (MA) model is used for time series forecasting by modeling the error term, representing the forecast's difference from the actual value.\n",
    "- The error term is assumed to be a random, uncorrelated process known as white noise.\n",
    "- To implement an MA model:\n",
    "  1. Visualize the time series data to detect trends, seasonality, or patterns.\n",
    "  2. Determine the model's order (q) using tools like Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF).\n",
    "  3. Fit the MA model to the data using the determined q value.\n",
    "  4. Utilize the model for forecasting future time series values.\n",
    "- To determine the MA model's order, one examines the Autocorrelation Function (ACF)."
