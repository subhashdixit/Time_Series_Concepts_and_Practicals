    "### **What Is Time Series Analysis?**\n",
    "- Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over time. In TSA, analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time Series Analysis Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Changes Over Time:**\n",
    "   - Figure out how time influences variables.\n",
    "   - Identify factors affecting things at different times.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unveiling Dataset Insights:**\n",
    "   - Analyze consequences and insights from changing dataset features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Predicting the Future:**\n",
    "   - Help predict future values of time series variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Assumption:**\n",
    "- Only one assumption: \"Stationary,\" meaning time's start doesn't impact statistical properties of the process."

    "\n",
    "To analyze time series effectively, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect and Clean Data:**\n",
    "   - Gather your data and make sure it's tidy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create Time vs Key Feature Visualizations:**\n",
    "   - Make charts that show how your key feature changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check Series Stationarity:**\n",
    "   - See if your series stays consistent over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understand the Nature with Charts:**\n",
    "   - Develop charts to grasp the characteristics of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Build Models – AR, MA, ARMA,ARIMA, SARIMA, SARIMAX, FBProphet, LSTM etc :**\n",
    "   - Use different models to analyze your time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Extract Insights from Predictions:**\n",
    "   - Gain valuable insights from the predictions made by your models.\n"

    "### **Understanding Time Series Analysis Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trend:** This is like the continuous flow of a storyline in the data. It could be going up (Positive), down (Negative), or staying constant (Null Trend).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Seasonality:** Imagine regular shifts in the data happening at fixed intervals, creating a pattern like a bell curve or a sawtooth.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cyclical:** Think of this as a less predictable, uncertain movement in the data with no fixed intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Irregularity:** These are the unexpected surprises in the data—sudden spikes or unusual events happening in a short period.\n",

    "1. **No Room for Missing Values:**\n",
    "   Time series analysis doesn't handle missing values well, just like some other models. So, when digging into our data, we need to be mindful of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Linear Relationships Required:**\n",
    "   The data points in time series must have a linear relationship. Think of it like the dots on a straight line, which helps the analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cost of Data Transformations:**\n",
    "   Transforming data is a must, but it comes at a price. It can be a bit costly, so we should be aware of the expenses involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Primarily for Uni-variate Data:**\n",
    "   Time series models are most effective with one variable at a time. They might not perform as well with multiple variables in the mix."

    "2. The mean value should stay constant throughout the analysis.\n",
    "3. The variance (how spread out the values are) should remain constant over time.\n",

    "   - Alternate Hypothesis (HA): The series is stationary.\n",

    "2. **Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) Test:** \n",

    "\n",
    "**Moving Average Methodology:**\n",
    "- A popular technique is the Moving Average, effective for smoothing short-term variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Moving Averages:**\n",
    "1. **Simple Moving Average (SMA):**\n",
    "- Calculate the unweighted mean of the previous \\( M \\) or \\( N \\) points. Adjust \\( M \\) or \\( N \\) for desired smoothing; higher values smooth more but reduce accuracy.\n",

    "3. **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):**\n",
    "- Identify trends and filter noise. It gives more weight to recent data, changing faster than SMA. The smoothing factor **${\\alpha}$**  determines weight, ranging from 0 to 1. Smaller **${\\alpha}$** values focus on recent data.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Partial Auto-Correlation Function (PACF):**\n",
    "- PACF is a bit trickier but closely related to ACF. It shows the correlation of a sequence with itself, considering a specific number of time units per sequence order. It focuses on the direct effect, removing other intermediary effects from the time series.\n",
